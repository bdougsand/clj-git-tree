# clj-git

A toy server created for a tutorial/workshop on git. It generates a simplified
JSON representation of a git repository, which it serves over a WebSocket as
changes occur. Used in conjunction with a modified version of (Learn Git
Branching)[https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching], powers a live-updating
view of the current structure of the repo.
